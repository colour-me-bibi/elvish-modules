# Implementing Set Operations in Elvish

# Elvish's built-in data structures and commands provide a solid foundation for implementing set operations in a way that feels similar to Python. Here's how we can achieve this:

## Data Structure:
# We'll represent sets as Elvish lists. While Elvish lists can contain duplicates, we'll enforce set semantics by ensuring that our functions remove duplicates before performing operations.

## Functions:
# Here are the essential set operations and their implementations:

#new: Creates a new set from a list, removing duplicates.
fnnew {|@elements|
  unique $@elements
}

#union: Returns a new set containing all unique elements from two sets.
fnunion {|$set1 $set2|
 new { $@set1 $@set2 }
}

#intersection: Returns a new set containing elements present in both sets.
fnintersection {|$set1 $set2|
 new { each {|e| if (contains $set2 $e) { put $e } } $@set1 }
}

#difference: Returns a new set containing elements present in the first set but not in the second.
fndifference {|$set1 $set2|
 new { each {|e| if (not (contains $set2 $e)) { put $e } } $@set1 }
}

#issubset: Checks if the first set is a subset of the second set.
fnissubset {|$set1 $set2|
  all { each {|e| contains $set2 $e } } $@set1
}

#issuperset: Checks if the first set is a superset of the second set.
fnissuperset {|$set1 $set2|
 issubset $set2 $set1
}

## Integration and Usage:
# Place the above functions in a file named sets.elv within the github.com/colour-me-bibi/elvish-modules/sets module.
# In your Elvish scripts, import the module using:
# use github.com/colour-me-bibi/elvish-modules/sets

# Use the functions like their Python counterparts:
# var set1 = (set:new [1 2 3])
# var set2 = (set:new [2 3 4])

# put (set:union $set1 $set2) # [1 2 3 4]
# put (set:intersection $set1 $set2) # [2 3]
# put (set:difference $set1 $set2) # [1]
# put (set:issubset $set1 $set2) # $false
# put (set:issuperset $set2 $set1) # $true

## Testing:
# Write unit tests for each function using Elvish's built-in testing capabilities. For example:
# test sets:union {
#   assert-equal (set:union [1 2] [2 3]) [1 2 3]
#   # Add more test cases
# }

# Run the tests using the elvish -c 'test' command within the module directory.
# This implementation provides a Python-like experience for working with sets in Elvish, allowing you to perform common set operations efficiently and intuitively.
